            Every few years, some trailblazing designer or well-known agency develops a new design method. Names are made. Books are sold. Lines are drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the UX community, we love to debate the merits of one method over another. We form rivalries and champion our views. It’s Human Centered Design vs Lean UX vs Design Sprints vs the latest approach trending online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite our differences, our adoption of design methods expresses a common desire. We aspire to bring order to the chaos of creation. Without methods, we’re susceptible to the unpredictability of design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deadlines change. Ideas fail. Feedback isn’t what we expect, and we lose our bearings. But if we have a logical way to investigate problems and test solutions, we can maintain focus no matter what obstacles lie in our path.
        </p>
        <p>
            As UX designers, we seek to understand what people need, how they think, and why they act the way they do. Our efforts must move us closer to the chief aim of UX design–creating delightful user experiences. Whatever design method we prefer, people are the focus. Such is the case with Design Thinking.
        </p>
        <h2>The Origins of Design Thinking</h2> 
        <p>
            In 1969, Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon sowed the seeds of Design Thinking in the pages of a book titled Sciences of the Artificial. Simon defined design as the “transformation of existing conditions into preferred ones” and stated that “design thinking is always linked to an improved future.”
        <p>
            In the 1980s, academics like Nigel Cross and Bryan Lawson identified a “designerly” approach to problem solving. According to Cross, design is the process of producing “a large range of satisfactory solutions rather than attempting to generate the one hypothetically-optimum solution.” Within the same decade, Peter Rowe, former director of urban design at Harvard, reflected on the “situational logic and decision making process of designers” in his book Design Thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of the ’90s, the trajectory of Design Thinking shifted from theoretical to commercial. “How do designers think,” became, “How to think like a designer.” Led by IDEO, Design Thinking was marketed as an innovative approach to overcoming complex, organizational challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the ’90s onward, Design Thinking experienced a steady rise in popularity as its influence bypassed the borders of design and sparked change in industries ranging from finance to information technology.
        </p>
        
        <h2>UX and Design Thinking Go Hand in Hand</h2>
        <p>
            Design is frequently confused for the artifacts it yields. Design equals a website, a sofa, or a smartphone. The equation is faulty. Design is not an artifact. It’s a systematic approach to solving problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Design Thinking is one way to solve problems. It’s an iterative process where ideas breathe life based on the needs, thoughts, and behaviors of real users. If there’s no collaboration between designers and users, it’s not Design Thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The overabundance of design methods is an asset. No approach works for every designer, team, or company. No process uncovers the needs of all users. Design thinking is a method, not magic, but its user-centricity makes for a natural pairing with UX design.
