		<h3>About me...</h3>
		<p>I am a International Student from Mexico studying a certificate program on Web Design. I chose this program because I studied Graphic Design in Mexico, so this complement my career. My main goals are to specialize on UX (user experience).</p>
		<p>I am a really outgoing person and I like meeting new people and learn of others. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. </p><p>I chose to study in Seattle because is a great sized city, not too crouded but enough to meet new people. The weather can be a hard factor to live in Seattle, but when you get use to it it can be great.</p>
		<p>The great things about studying abroad is that you learn of other cultures and improve or learn other languages. But what makes this experience amazing, is that you make new friends from all over the world that turn into family, and if you want to visit them to their country they will show you around.</p>
